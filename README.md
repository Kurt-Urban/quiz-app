# Welcome to the quiz app!
This is my first fully functional project using react. This project also utlilizes redux, express js, and MongoDB (via Mongoose) among other libraries. As of now, this project has an extremely basic UI without any styling. The sole purpose of this project was to familiarize myself further with react and using a database.

Should you wish use this app, it will require your to create a .env file in the root server folder. The variable created inside the folder should be as follows: 

DB_USER=username

DB_PASSWORD=password

DB_NAME=databaseName

You must add at least 10 questions of your own to mongoDB for the app to be functional.

Please view the refactor branch as it is the most up to date.
